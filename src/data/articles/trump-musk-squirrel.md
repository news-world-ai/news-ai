# Trump's Wild White House Pet: Meet Musk the Mischievous Squirrel

In the storied halls and manicured grounds of the White House, tradition reigns supreme. Past presidents have kept pets as companions, from Franklin D. Roosevelt's beloved Fala the terrier to Obama's playful Bo and Sunny. But in a move characteristic of his unorthodox style, former President Donald Trump opted for a decidedly unconventional companion: a squirrel named Musk. This eccentric, furry friend, who spent months on the White House grounds, left a curious, humorous mark on Trump's legacy—one that defied the prim and polished image of the presidential residence.

While no one's entirely sure how Musk found his way to the South Lawn, the prevailing tale is that he first caught Trump's eye while scampering through the cherry trees during a walk on a brisk winter morning. According to an inside source, Trump was instantly charmed by Musk's tenacity and energy, reminding him of the "go-getters" he admired. "He's got fight! He's got spirit!" Trump allegedly remarked. Before long, Musk had become a regular fixture, winning over the former president's affection and eventually earning a sort of "First Squirrel" status in the White House.

## A First Squirrel Tradition

Musk may have been a small creature in the grand scheme of history, but he brought a wave of warmth and laughter to a place often marked by serious affairs and political debates. White House staff began seeing Musk near the South Lawn, where he would energetically bound from tree to tree, playfully rustling leaves as if putting on a show. Word quickly spread, and Musk earned a growing fan base among staff, security personnel, and occasional visitors.

Trump's fondness for Musk became clear in the lengths he went to accommodate his newfound friend. Recognizing Musk's penchant for munching, he ordered the installation of a deluxe squirrel feeding station, just outside the Oval Office window. It was stocked with a lavish selection of high-end nuts, acorns, and fruits. But this wasn't just any feeding station; it was complete with a miniature "First Squirrel" plaque and even decorated in shades of gold and red. "He's got his own little buffet," joked one aide. "We don't even have this level of service for staff snacks!"

In a particularly bold move, Trump dubbed the squirrel "Musk," partly in homage to Elon Musk, with whom he had an amicable, if occasionally competitive, rapport. Just as the tech mogul was known for daring pursuits, Musk the squirrel became a daily daredevil on the White House grounds, performing stunts that captured the imagination of everyone around. No branch was too high, no jump too ambitious; Musk was fearless, and Trump saw in him a kindred spirit.

## Musk's Escapades

From the moment Musk became a fixture on the White House grounds, he kept everyone on their toes—sometimes quite literally. Musk was notorious for his "dives" off the trees, leaping down near the Oval Office walkway as if he were parachuting from a great height. Staff would occasionally find him darting across the Rose Garden pathways, a blur of gray-brown fur on some mischievous mission, sometimes even startling officials with his speed and audacity.

More than once, Musk's exploits caused interruptions to official proceedings. During a press conference in the Rose Garden, Musk infamously darted into the spotlight, briefly stealing the stage before a bewildered press corps. Trump was reportedly amused and unapologetic, later quipping to the press, "I think he just wanted to say a few words." This incident, of course, only elevated Musk's popularity, making him a quirky highlight of the administration.

## Presidential Pet or Rogue Element?

Not everyone found Musk as charming as Trump. Some of the more traditional staff felt that a squirrel was an undignified choice for a presidential pet, even if unofficially. Musk had a habit of sneaking into unusual places, once even making his way into a planning meeting where he supposedly rifled through papers. "I swear he thought he was reviewing them," laughed one staff member.

The special accommodations Musk enjoyed weren't limited to nuts and acorns. When winter hit, Trump reportedly requested a miniature squirrel shelter be installed in the trees on the South Lawn—a sort of "winter retreat" for Musk. Built by local carpenters, it included a cozy nest box with heating, because, as Trump allegedly put it, "No friend of mine's freezing out there."

## Social Media Stardom and International Attention

Musk's fame didn't stay confined to the White House grounds for long. Once his antics began circulating through word-of-mouth, social media took notice. Pictures of Musk "posing" by the Oval Office, or darting through the Rose Garden, began appearing on Twitter and Instagram. Before long, Musk the squirrel had amassed his own following, with hashtags like #FirstSquirrel and #SquirrelScandal gaining traction.

Even international news outlets picked up on the story, with journalists eagerly covering the "First Squirrel" as a lighthearted counterpart to heavier political news. Some international leaders, intrigued by the unusual pet, sent gifts of premium nuts from their own countries. French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly sent a gift basket of chestnuts and hazelnuts, which Trump presented to Musk with a wink and the words, "From your French friends."

## The End of an Era

As Trump's time in office came to a close, many wondered what would happen to Musk. There were lighthearted jokes about him joining the presidential library, or being listed as an "unofficial White House advisor." In reality, Musk continued his life on the White House grounds, but his legacy remained.

When President Biden took office, staffers noted Musk's initial hesitancy around the new administration. But over time, Musk warmed up to the change and returned to his playful ways, bringing laughter to the new administration as he had with the old. He had become a fixture at the White House, and a new chapter of "First Squirrel" lore was ready to begin.

In the end, Musk the squirrel's story is a testament to the unexpected, quirky, and often endearing ways that animals can bring lightness to our lives. Trump's bond with Musk was one marked by spontaneity and laughter, a unique and unforgettable chapter in the long history of the White House. Where other presidents had dogs or cats, Trump had Musk—a reminder that history is sometimes made not just by who sits in the Oval Office, but also by those who scamper, climb, and snack just outside its windows.
